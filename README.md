## View Interactive Dashboard Here: https://lnkd.in/dbVfgq2G

**Focus:** Student Achievement | Teacher Impact | Assessment Trends  
**Tools Used:** Power BI | Data Modeling | Interactive Dashboards

## Objective  
This dashboard goes beyond academic metrics—it reveals the systemic dynamics shaping student outcomes and educator performance across a multinational learning environment. By visualizing assessment trends, score distributions, and teacher influence, it empowers education leaders to make data-driven decisions that elevate learning outcomes and instructional quality.

## Analytical Approach  
- Modeled student performance across subjects, semesters, and grade levels  
- Integrated teacher data including experience and assessment volume  
- Built interactive dashboards with drill-through filters for student, teacher, and subject views  
- Enabled cross-semester comparisons and performance tracking  
- Applied correlation analysis to explore teacher impact on student scores

## Key Insights

- **Student Performance**  
  - Total Score Achieved: 3.13M across 50 students  
  - Average Score per Student: 70.93  
  - Weighted Score per Student: 16.02  
  - Highest Grade Achieved: A+ by all students

- **Assessment Trends**  
  - 44,392 assessments taken  
  - 79% passed, 21% failed  
  - YOY Performance: 98% pass rate increase, 83.9% fail rate increase  
  - Semester Score Variation: Fall (70.81), Spring (70.63), Summer (67.23)

- **Top Performers**  
  - Luis Meyer, Harper Martinez, and Sophia Fischer each achieved a weighted average of 87

- **Teacher Impact**  
  - 5 teachers managed 50 students and 44,392 assessments  
  - Average Experience: 10.2 years; Maximum: 15 years  
  - Correlation observed between teacher experience and student score improvement

- **Geographic Reach**  
  - Students from 11 countries, indicating a diverse learning cohort

## Strategic Recommendations  
- **Performance Replication**: Analyze top students’ learning paths and replicate across cohorts  
- **Curriculum Calibration**: Address seasonal score dips, especially in summer semesters  
- **Teacher Development**: Leverage experienced educators for mentorship and curriculum design  
- **Assessment Optimization**: Refine assessment formats to reduce failure rates and improve engagement  
- **Global Cohort Strategy**: Tailor learning interventions to diverse national backgrounds

## Visual Highlights  
- Score distribution across semesters and subjects  
- Assessment pass/fail trends over time  
- Teacher experience vs. student performance correlation chart  
- Top student leaderboard with weighted averages  
- Grade breakdown across subjects and timelines

## Executive Insight  
This project demonstrates how educational data can be transformed into strategic intelligence. By connecting student achievement with teacher impact and assessment trends, the dashboard empowers institutions to elevate learning outcomes, refine curriculum design, and foster a more inclusive and effective academic environment.
